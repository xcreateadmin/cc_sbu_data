The image shows a metal fence with square holes in it. The fence appears to be made of steel and has a matte finish. The holes in the fence are arranged in a grid pattern, with each square measuring about 2 inches by 2 inches. The fence is mounted on top of a brick wall, which appears to be the same color as the fence. There are several bushes growing in front of the fence, and some of them are visible through the holes in the fence. The overall appearance of the fence is modern and sleek.
