The image shows a view from a balcony or rooftop overlooking a body of water with boats in the distance. The water is a deep blue and there are mountains in the background. The sky is clear and the sun is setting behind the mountains, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. There are several buildings on the other side of the water, including what appears to be a church with a tall steeple. There are also some trees and other greenery in the foreground.
