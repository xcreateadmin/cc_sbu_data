This image shows a group of people standing in front of a large structure made of ice. The structure appears to be shaped like a castle, with tall, pointed towers and a large, arched entranceway. The people in the image are looking up at it and taking pictures. In the background, there is a snowy landscape with trees and mountains visible in the distance. The sky is cloudy and the sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the scene.
