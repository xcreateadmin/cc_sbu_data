This image is a stylized representation of a human skull depicted in a low polygonal style with sharp angles and clean lines. The skull is shown in profile with the left side visible and the right side obscured by the hairline. It appears to be made up of several geometric shapes, including triangles and rectangles. The background is a slightly lighter shade of the same color as the skull, creating an overall effect of simplicity and minimalism.
