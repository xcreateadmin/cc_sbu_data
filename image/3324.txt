This image shows a curling player in action during a game. The player is wearing an orange and black jersey with black pants and black shoes. They are holding a broom in one hand and a stone in the other, crouched down on one knee, preparing to throw the stone down the ice. The image is taken from the side, showing the player's face and the stone in mid-air. The background is a blue and white rink with spectators watching from the stands.
