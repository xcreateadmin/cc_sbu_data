This image shows a bride and groom standing in the middle of a hedge maze at a wedding venue. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo. They are both smiling and posing for the camera. In the background, there is a large, old mansion with many windows and chimneys. The sky is cloudy and it looks like it might be raining. The hedge maze is made up of tall, green hedges that are trimmed into intricate shapes. The ground is covered in grass and there are no other people visible in the image.
