This is an image of three alpacas standing in a pen. The first alpaca is black with a white face, the second is white with a black face, and the third is brown with a white face. They are all standing next to each other and looking at the camera. There is a fence separating them from the viewer, and there is hay in the pen with them. The background is a mix of dirt and grass.
