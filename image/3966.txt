This image shows a bride and groom walking down the aisle at their wedding. They are both wearing formal attire, with the bride in a white dress and the groom in a black tuxedo. They are holding hands and smiling as they walk towards the camera. Behind them, you can see a group of people standing on a grassy hill, watching the ceremony. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange light on the scene.
