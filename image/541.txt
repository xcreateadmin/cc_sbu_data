This is a black and white photograph of an old car parked on a street in Havana, Cuba. The car appears to be a vintage model, possibly from the 1950s or 1960s. It is parked on the right side of the road, facing in the direction of the camera. There are no people or other vehicles visible in the image. The street is lined with old buildings on both sides, some of which appear to be in disrepair. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with the sun setting behind the buildings on the left side of the image. The overall mood of the image is one of nostalgia and decay.
