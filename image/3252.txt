This image is a diagram of an electric field from a uniform line of charge. The electric field is represented by the lines of force that emanate from the charged line. These lines of force indicate the direction and magnitude of the electric field at any point in space. The direction of the electric field is perpendicular to the line of charge. In this diagram, the electric field is uniform, meaning that the magnitude of the electric field is constant at all points in space. This is indicated by the fact that the lines of force are parallel and equidistant from the charged line.
