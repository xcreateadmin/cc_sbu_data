There are three beer glasses on the table, each with a different type of beer in it. The first glass has a light beer in it, the second has a dark beer, and the third has a lager in it. All of the glasses have condensation on the outside. The table has a few scratches and dings in it. There are a few empty glasses on the table as well. The room is dimly lit, with a few candles on the tables and a fireplace in the corner. There are a few people sitting at the tables, chatting and enjoying their drinks.
