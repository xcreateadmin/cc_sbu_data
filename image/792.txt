This is an image of a disassembled laptop with the hard drive being removed from the motherboard. The hard drive is connected to the motherboard by two cables, with one being held by the person's hand in the image. The person is gently pulling on the cable to remove the hard drive.

The laptop has a black case with a silver keyboard and touchpad. There are vents on the bottom of the laptop to cool the components. The hard drive is on the right side of the laptop, and the power supply is on the left.

Several screws hold the laptop together, which need to be removed to access the hard drive. The screws are near the vents on the bottom of the laptop.
