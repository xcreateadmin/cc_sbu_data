The image shows a group of people standing around a tree that has been planted in the ground. One person is holding a hose and spraying water onto the roots of the tree, while another person is holding a shovel and digging around the base of the tree. The people are wearing yellow shirts and green hats, and there is a green tarp on the ground next to the tree. The background is a grassy field with some trees in the distance.
