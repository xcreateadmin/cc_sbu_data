This image shows a white Toyota Land Cruiser with a roof rack and a spare tire on the back parked in the sand in the middle of a desert. A person is standing next to the car, looking at it. The person is wearing a blue shirt and shorts, and has a backpack on their back. The clear blue sky has some clouds in the distance. The sun is shining down on the scene, casting shadows on the sand and the car. There are no other objects or people in the image.
