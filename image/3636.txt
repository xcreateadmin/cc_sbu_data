This is a schematic diagram of an optical fiber amplifier used for amplifying optical signals in a fiber optic system. It shows the basic components, including a pump laser, an optical fiber, and a detector. The pump laser is used to pump energy into the optical fiber, which amplifies the signal as it travels through the fiber. The detector is used to detect the amplified signal and convert it into an electrical signal for further processing. The diagram also shows the two types of optical fibers that can be used in an optical fiber amplifier: single mode fibers with a small core diameter that allow only one mode of light to propagate through them, and multimode fibers with a larger core diameter that allow multiple modes of light to propagate through them.
