This image shows a lamp with a light blue shade and a gold base decorated with a floral pattern in shades of blue and white. The lamp appears to be made of metal and has a curved shape. There is a cord coming out of the top of the lamp that is plugged into an electrical outlet. The lamp is sitting on a wooden surface, possibly a table or a shelf, and there is a reflection of the lamp in the surface, making it appear as if there are two lamps instead of one.
