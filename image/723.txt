This image is a 3D representation of a dental implant, which is a titanium post surgically placed into the jawbone to support a replacement tooth or bridge. The implant is connected to the jawbone through osseointegration, allowing the bone to grow around the implant and hold it in place. The implant is then capped with a crown, the visible part of the tooth in the mouth.
