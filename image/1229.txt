This image depicts a lineman working on an electrical pole. The lineman is wearing a yellow hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, and a harness. He is holding a bucket in one hand and using the other to climb up the pole. The pole is wooden and has metal crossbars for the lineman to hold onto while working. The sky is cloudy and there is a power line running from the pole to a nearby building.
