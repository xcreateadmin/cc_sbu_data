This is a screenshot of a PowerPoint slide with an image of a bar graph showing the number of deposits and withdrawals in a bank account over time. The graph is divided into two sections, one for deposits and one for withdrawals. The deposit section shows a steady increase over time, while the withdrawal section shows a steady decrease over time.
