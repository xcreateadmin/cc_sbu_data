This image is a diagram of the earth's energy balance. It shows the incoming energy from the sun (solar radiation) and the outgoing energy from the earth (longwave radiation). The diagram displays the earth's atmosphere, which absorbs and reflects some of the incoming energy. The earth's surface also absorbs and reflects some of the incoming energy.
