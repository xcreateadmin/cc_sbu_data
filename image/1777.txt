This image depicts a female police officer standing in a relaxed stance, wearing a police uniform with a white shirt, black pants, and black shoes. Her hair is styled in a ponytail, and she is wearing a name tag on her chest. She is holding her hand up, as if she is signaling for someone to stop or wait. The background is not visible, but it is likely that she is standing in front of a police station or vehicle.
