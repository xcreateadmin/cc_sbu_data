The image shows a full moon shining over a rocky coastline with a lighthouse in the distance. The sky is dark, but the moon's light illuminates the landscape. The water is calm and still, reflecting the moon's glow. The lighthouse is a tall, white structure with a red roof and a beacon on top. It stands on a rocky outcropping near the water's edge. In the foreground, there are several large rocks jutting out of the water, with smaller rocks and pebbles scattered around them. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene, with the moon casting a magical glow over the scene.
