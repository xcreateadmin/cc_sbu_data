The image depicts a yellow flower growing in a rocky mountain landscape with a cloudy and misty mountain range in the background. The petals of the flower are long and thin, with a slightly wavy texture, and the center of the flower is a darker yellow color. Small green plants surround the base of the flower, some of which appear to be moss or lichen. The angle of the image is low, looking up at the flower, which is the main focus of the image.
