This image shows a dish of pineapple salsa in a bowl with tortilla chips on the side. The salsa appears to be a mixture of diced pineapple, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and other seasonings. The tortilla chips are scattered around the bowl, and there is a small amount of salsa on each chip. The overall color scheme of the dish is bright and vibrant, with the red onion and cilantro providing contrast to the yellow and green of the pineapple.
