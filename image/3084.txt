This image shows a black bear catching a fish in its mouth while standing on a rock in a stream. The bear appears to be a juvenile, based on its size and the fact that it is still nursing from its mother. The water in the stream is clear and the rocks are jagged and uneven. There are trees and foliage in the background, and the sky appears to be overcast.
