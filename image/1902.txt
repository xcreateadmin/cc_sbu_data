The image is a black and white photograph of a brain. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, with the right hemisphere shown on the left side of the image and the left hemisphere shown on the right side of the image. The hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, which is a bundle of nerve fibers that transmit information between the two hemispheres. The right hemisphere processes and interprets sensory information from the left side of the body and controls the left side of the body. The left hemisphere processes and interprets sensory information from the right side of the body and controls the right side of the body. The brain controls many of the body's functions, including movement.
