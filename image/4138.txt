This is a photograph of a woman standing on a treadmill in a gym. She is wearing a blue tank top and black leggings, and has her hair tied back in a ponytail. The gym is large and well lit, with several other people working out on treadmills and weight machines in the background. The walls are painted white and there are large windows letting in natural light.

The woman is looking down at her phone, which is in her hand. The treadmill in front of her has a digital display showing her speed and distance traveled.

There are several other pieces of cardio equipment in the gym, including ellipticals and stationary bikes. Some of these are being used by other people, while others are standing idle.
