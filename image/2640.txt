This is a pencil drawing of a woman's face wearing a white shirt, with her hair in a ponytail. The drawing is in black and white, with shades of gray used for the woman's face and hair. The background is not visible. The woman's face is the focal point, with defined features created by shading, including highlights on the forehead and cheekbones and shadows in the eye sockets and around the mouth. This is a well-done drawing that captures the essence of the woman's expression.
