This image shows a group of black and white sheep standing on a dirt path next to a fence. The sheep are all facing the same direction and appear to be looking at something outside of the frame. The fence is made of metal bars and there is a small opening in it where the sheep are standing. The ground is covered in dirt and there is a small patch of grass visible in the foreground. The sky is cloudy and overcast.
