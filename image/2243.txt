This image shows a red scooter parked in front of a building with a blue and white tiled facade. The scooter is leaning against the wall of the building, with its front wheel resting on the ground. The wall behind the scooter is also covered in the same blue and white tiles as the building's facade. There is a window on the second floor of the building, with a small balcony outside it. The window has a white frame and is decorated with blue and white tiles. The pavement in front of the building is made of cobblestones, and there are no other vehicles or people.
