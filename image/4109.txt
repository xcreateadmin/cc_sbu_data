This is a photograph of a group of cows standing in a pasture. The cows are all black and white, except for one brown and white calf. The calf stands next to its mother, who looks at the camera. Other cows are grazing on the grass in the field. A fence can be seen in the background, along with some trees in the distance. The sky is clear and blue.
