This is a bottle of wine. It has a label that says "painted rock" in white letters on a black background. The bottle is sitting on a black marble countertop in front of a white wall. There is a silver wine opener next to the bottle, and a white wine glass on the other side. In the background, there is a man in a white shirt sitting at a table with a black and white checkered tablecloth. He is holding a white wine glass and looking at the bottle.
