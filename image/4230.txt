This is an image of a woman doing a handstand on a bar in a circus tent. The woman is wearing a red shirt and black leggings, and has her hair tied back in a ponytail. She is holding onto the bar with one hand and lifting herself up with the other. The bar is attached to the top of the tent, and there are other circus equipment visible in the background. The tent itself is a large, red and white striped structure with a peaked roof. There are several other people visible in the background, some of whom are watching the woman do her handstand and others who are working on setting up the circus equipment.
