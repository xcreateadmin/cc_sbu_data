The image is a hand-drawn illustration of the Olympic torch, which is made of metal with a long, curved handle and a blue, wavy line flame at the top. This simple and iconic design makes it easily recognizable as a symbol of the Olympic Games.

The Olympic torch is lit during the opening ceremony of the Games and is carried by a relay team of athletes around the host country, symbolizing the spirit of the Games. It is then used to light the cauldron during the closing ceremony, signifying the end of the Games.

The Olympic torch has been a symbol of the Games since 1928, and is an important part of the international multi-sport event that takes place every four years.
