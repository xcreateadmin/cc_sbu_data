This image shows a bride and groom dancing in the grass at sunset. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo. They are both holding their hands up in the air, as if they are celebrating their wedding day. The sun is setting behind them, casting a warm orange light on their faces and the grass. There are trees in the background, and the sky is pink and orange from the sunset.
