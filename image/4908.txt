The image is a grey crop top with an embroidered design on the left chest. The design is a cartoon of a cat wearing a chef's hat and apron, holding a frying pan in one paw and a spatula in the other. The design is stitched in white thread on a grey background. The top is a women's size small made of 100% cotton with a round neckline and short sleeves. The armholes and bottom hem are double stitched for durability. The design is centered on the left chest, measuring approximately 2.5 inches wide by 3.5 inches tall. The top is machine washable in cold water and can be tumbled dry on low heat. It is recommended to avoid ironing the design to prevent damage to the embroidery.
