This is a black and white image of a woman's face with the words "black queen" written in white letters on her forehead. The woman has an afro hairstyle and is wearing a crown made of braids. Her eyes are closed and she has a serene expression on her face. The image has a vintage feel to it, with a slightly grainy texture and a slightly muted color palette. The overall effect is one of elegance and regality.
