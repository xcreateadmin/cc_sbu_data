The image shows a dirt road in the middle of a foggy countryside with two yellow houses on either side of the road. A white fence separates the houses from the road. Both houses have green roofs and white trim around the windows and doors. Tall trees line the road on both sides, and there are no other buildings visible. The sky is overcast and gray with thick fog covering the ground.
