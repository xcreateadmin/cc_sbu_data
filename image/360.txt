The painting depicts a serene scene of a large blue house with white trim and a tall tower on top, surrounded by a white picket fence and a small green lawn. A woman in a flowing dress stands on the porch, looking out at the view, with a contemplative expression. Behind her is a large window that frames a view of the ocean and some boats in the distance, with two pale blue curtains. The bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds adds to the peaceful mood of the image.
