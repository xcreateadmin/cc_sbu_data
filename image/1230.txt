This image shows a bride and groom standing in a field of tall grass at sunset. The couple is embracing and looking into each other's eyes. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo. The sun is setting behind them, casting a warm orange light on their faces and the grass. There are trees in the background, and the sky is pink and orange from the sunset.
