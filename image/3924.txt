This is an image of an ostrich standing in a field of tall grass. The ostrich has black feathers and a long neck. It stands in the middle of the field with its head tilted to the side and its beak open. The sky is clear and blue with a few fluffy clouds visible in the distance. The grass in the foreground is tall and waving in the breeze.
