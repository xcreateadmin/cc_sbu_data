The image shows a CD on a wooden table. The CD has a picture of a woman on the cover, wearing a long dress and with her hair pulled back. She is standing on a rock in the middle of a river, surrounded by trees and mountains in the background. The title of the album is written in bold letters on the bottom of the cover.
