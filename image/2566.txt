The image shows a row of clocks with different times on them. The clock on the left reads 12:00, the one in the middle reads 3:00, and the one on the right reads 6:00. The clocks have white faces and black hands. They are arranged in a straight line, slightly overlapping each other. They are mounted on a white wall, and there is nothing else in the image.
