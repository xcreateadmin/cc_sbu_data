This is an image of a dollar bill with a syringe sitting on top of it. The syringe appears to be filled with a clear liquid and has a needle attached to the end. The dollar bill is lying on top of a white surface, and there is a small puddle of liquid next to the syringe. The background of the image is blurred, but it appears to be a light colored surface.
