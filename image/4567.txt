The image depicts a giraffe standing on its hind legs with its front legs bent, neck stretched out, head tilted to the side, and eyes looking down. Its ears are perked up, and its tongue is hanging out of its mouth. The giraffe has a long and thin body, with a brown coat and white spots. It is standing on a yellow background and is wearing a red bow tie tied around its neck.
