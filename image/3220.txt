This image shows the process of making a cake. There are several steps involved, including mixing the ingredients, pouring the batter into a pan, baking the cake in the oven, and frosting it with whipped cream.

To make the cake, mix sugar, eggs, flour, baking powder, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Then, pour the batter into a baking pan and bake it in the oven. After baking, let the cake cool on a wire rack. Once the cake is cool, spread whipped cream on top of it using a spatula.
