This image shows a street scene in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. The tall and ornate buildings on either side of the street have balconies and wrought iron railings. The street is lined with parked cars, and people are walking on the sidewalk. In the distance, a trolley car travels down the street. The sky is clear and blue without any clouds.
