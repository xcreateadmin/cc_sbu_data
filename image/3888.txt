The image shows a bedroom with two twin beds, each with a white headboard and black and white striped bedspreads. The walls are painted white, and there is a large window with white curtains. The floor is made of wooden planks, and there is a small table with a lamp on it next to one of the beds. The room is well lit, with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
