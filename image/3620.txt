The painting depicts a dark, cloudy sky with a full moon shining brightly in the distance. In the foreground, there is a large, gothic cathedral with tall, pointed spires reaching up towards the sky, surrounded by a grassy field and a few scattered trees. In the distance, some small, dark buildings are barely visible in the dim light. The overall mood of the painting is eerie and mysterious, with the moon casting an eerie glow on the cathedral and its surroundings.
