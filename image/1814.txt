This is an image of a bus parked in front of a building at an airport. The building is made of white and blue tiles and has a large arched entrance with palm trees on either side. The bus is a large blue and white vehicle with the words "Abu Dhabi" written on the side in white letters. People are standing around the bus, including a man in a white shirt and black pants who appears to be talking on a cell phone and a woman in a black abaya and headscarf who is walking away from the bus. The image is taken from the front of the bus, looking towards the entrance of the building. The sky is clear and blue with a few fluffy clouds visible in the distance.
