This is a photograph of a kitchen. The walls are painted white, and the floor is made of wooden planks. The countertops and cabinets are made of black granite and wood respectively. There is a stainless steel sink on top of the counter along with a faucet and garbage disposal. All the appliances including refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher are made of stainless steel. A large window above the sink allows natural light to come in making the room well lit. The overall design of the kitchen is modern and sleek with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic.
