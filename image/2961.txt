This image shows a woman walking down a narrow, cobblestone street in a small town. The buildings on either side of the street are old and made of stone, with wooden balconies and wrought iron railings. The woman is wearing a white shirt and black pants, and has her hands in her pockets as she walks. There are no cars or other people visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and overcast.
