This is a black and white ink drawing of a gate in the middle of a field. The gate is made of metal and has a rusty appearance. Tall grasses and weeds are growing on either side of the gate. In the background, a hill with trees on it can be seen, and in the distance, there is a body of water. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene.
