This is a photograph of a young girl playing in the sand on a beach. The girl is wearing a black and white dress and is sitting on her hands and knees in the sand. In the background, you can see the ocean and some palm trees. The girl appears to be building something out of the sand with her hands. The sand around her is smooth and flat, and there are no footprints or other marks in it. The sky is clear and blue, and there are a few fluffy clouds visible in the distance.
