This image shows a sunset over an oil field with pump jacks in the foreground. The sun is setting behind the pump jacks, casting a warm glow over the scene. The sky is filled with clouds, some of which are lit up by the sun's rays. The pump jacks are tall, metal structures with arms that move up and down to pump oil out of the ground. They are arranged in a row, with some of them visible in the foreground and others in the background. The oil field is surrounded by flat, barren land. There are no other buildings or structures visible in the image.
