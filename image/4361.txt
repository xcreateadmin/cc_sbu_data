This image shows a large, open space with a stage in the center. The stage has a black and white checkerboard pattern on it, and there are two staircases leading up to it on either side. The walls of the room are painted black, and there are several large windows letting in natural light. The floor is made of wooden planks, and there are several rows of chairs set up in front of the stage. The room appears to be empty, with no people or objects in sight.
