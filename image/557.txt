This image is a photograph of a courtyard with a rectangular stone fountain in the center. The courtyard is surrounded by arches and domes, adorned with intricate geometric patterns on the walls. The water in the fountain is clear and reflects the blue sky above. A person, wearing a blue shirt and pants with their hands in their pockets, stands on the edge of the fountain, looking at the camera. The courtyard is otherwise empty except for the fountain and the person.
