This is a framed picture with a brown wooden frame. Inside the frame, there is a black and white photograph of a man standing on a stage with a microphone in his hand. The man is wearing a suit and tie, and he is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression on his face. Behind the man, there is a large banner with the words 'person' printed on it in white letters. There is a spotlight shining down on the man from above, and it is casting a shadow on the floor in front of him. The background of the photograph is dark.
