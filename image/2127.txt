This is an image of a person standing next to a tree in a parking lot. The person is wearing a blue jacket and holding a shovel. They appear to be digging around the base of the tree with the shovel, where there is a small pile of rocks. In the background, there are several parked vehicles and a mountain range can be seen in the distance.
