This is a painting of a street scene with buildings on either side and people walking on the sidewalk. There is a blue sky with clouds in the background. The buildings are made of yellow bricks and have white windows and doors. There are trees on either side of the street and a few cars parked on the side of the road. The people walking on the sidewalk are dressed in various clothing, including hats, coats, and scarves. Some are carrying bags or umbrellas, while others are just walking casually. The buildings on either side of the street have different shapes and sizes, with some having balconies and others not. Overall, this is a peaceful and idyllic scene of a small town.
