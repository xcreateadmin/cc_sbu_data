This painting depicts a brown and white hunting dog standing in a wooded area. The dog is standing on its hind legs, with its front paws resting on a tree stump. The dog's ears are perked up, and it is looking intently at something in the distance. The background is a mix of trees and underbrush, with some sunlight filtering through the leaves. The overall mood of the painting is one of anticipation and excitement, as if the dog is about to pounce on its prey.
