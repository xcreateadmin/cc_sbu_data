This image depicts a woman in an orange dress and a man in a tuxedo walking down a red carpet at an event. The woman is holding an umbrella and the man is holding her arm. They both have smiles on their faces, suggesting they are enjoying themselves. The woman's dress is a shiny, orange floor-length gown with a sweetheart neckline, fitted bodice, and full, flared skirt. She is wearing matching strappy, high-heeled shoes. The man is wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt and a black bow tie, along with black lace-up dress shoes. The background is not visible, but the setting seems to be well-lit and indoors.
