This is a picture of a bar with four beer taps mounted on a wooden wall with a dark stain. The taps are made of metal and labeled differently. A light above the taps illuminates them. The wooden bar also has a dark stain, and there are a few stools in front of the taps, but no one is sitting at the bar.
