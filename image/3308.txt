This image shows a herd of horses running through a body of water. The horses are brown and black, with their manes and tails flowing in the wind. They are all running in the same direction, as if they are being chased by something. The water is splashing up around their hooves as they run. In the background, there are some trees and hills that can be seen through the mist. It looks like a beautiful, wild scene.
