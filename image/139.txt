This is an image of a tapered roller bearing. The bearing is made up of an outer ring, an inner ring, and a number of tapered rollers in between to support a heavy load while still being able to rotate smoothly. The outer ring is typically larger in diameter and made of steel or cast iron, while the inner ring is typically smaller in diameter and made of a softer material like brass or bronze. The rollers are made of hardened steel and positioned between the outer and inner rings. This type of bearing is commonly used in machinery, vehicles, and heavy equipment due to its ability to handle high loads.
