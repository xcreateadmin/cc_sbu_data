This image is a black sweatshirt with white lettering on the front that reads, `'that's what she said.' The design features a snowman, a reindeer, and a penguin, all of which are wearing hats and scarves. The sweatshirt has a crew neck and long sleeves, and it appears to be made of a soft, comfortable material. The design would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys holiday humor.
