This is a photograph of a young woman standing on a city street, talking on her cell phone. She is wearing a black coat and a pink scarf, and has long, straight black hair. She is looking down at her phone, which is held up to her ear with her left hand. The background of the image is a busy city street, with cars and pedestrians passing by. There are tall buildings in the background, and the sky is overcast.
