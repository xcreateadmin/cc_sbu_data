This image shows a piece of paper with a handwritten quote on it. The quote is written in black ink on a white background: "you are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray, you'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away." The paper is folded in half and appears to be part of a larger piece of paper or cardstock. There are no other visible objects in the image.
