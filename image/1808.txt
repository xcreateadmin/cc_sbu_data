The image shows two women lying on top of a boat in the middle of the ocean at night. One woman is lying on her back with her arms behind her head, while the other woman is lying on her stomach, looking up at the sky. The sky is filled with stars and the water is dark and still. The boat is made of wood and appears to be old and weathered. There are no other objects or people visible in the image.
