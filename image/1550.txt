This image appears to be a photograph of a person standing on a rocky beach with the ocean in the background. The person is standing with their back to the camera, looking out at the water. The sun is shining down on the person's back, casting a shadow on the ground. There are some rocks in the foreground, and the waves are crashing against them. The sky appears to be a bright blue with some clouds in it.
