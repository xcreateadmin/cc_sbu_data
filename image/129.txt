This is a black and white image of the logo for the fashion brand, Chanel. The logo is made up of the letters "C" and "H" in white, on a black background. The letters are stacked on top of each other, with the "C" on the left and the "H" on the right. This creates a sense of balance and symmetry in the design. The black and white color scheme gives it a sleek and sophisticated look.
