This is a painting of two men in a studio. One man is sitting at an easel, holding a paintbrush and palette, while the other man stands behind him, looking over his shoulder. Both men are wearing blue shirts and jeans, and the man standing has a red cap on his head. The background of the painting is a plain white wall, and there are no other objects or people in the scene. The overall mood of the painting is one of concentration and focus, as the man at the easel works on his art.
