The painting depicts a view of a canal in Venice, Italy, lined with buildings on both sides with balconies overlooking the water. A gondola with two people sitting in it is in the middle of the canal. The left buildings are taller and more ornate than the right. The sky is overcast with mostly muted colors of browns, grays, and blues. The overall mood is quiet and peaceful, with a sense of stillness in the water and air.
