There are two women sitting on the ground in the middle of a field. They are both wearing long brown skirts and have their legs crossed. One of the women is looking up at the sky, while the other is looking down at her phone. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The grass and reeds around them are tall and swaying in the breeze.
