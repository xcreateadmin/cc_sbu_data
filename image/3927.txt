This is a black and white photograph of a group of men walking through the ruins of a building. The men are dressed in suits and ties, and they are walking in a line, with one man leading the way. The building behind them is in ruins, with large chunks of stone and debris scattered around it. The sky is cloudy and grey, and there are no trees or other vegetation visible in the background.
