This image is a photograph of a wave crashing against the shore of a body of water at sunset. The water is a deep blue and the sky is a mix of orange and pink. The wave is large and powerful, with water spraying up into the air as it crashes against the rocky and jagged shore. The foreground has several large rocks visible. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene, with warm colors of the sunset and the calmness of the ocean.
