This image shows a large white and blue ferry boat docked at a pier with a large building in the background. The ferry appears to be in the process of loading or unloading passengers, as there are people walking on and off the boat. The building in the background appears to be a large warehouse or cargo terminal, with several cranes and other machinery visible on the dock in front of it. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with a few fluffy clouds visible.
