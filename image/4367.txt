The image shows two horses running through a river. One horse is brown and the other is white with a brown mane and tail. They are both galloping through the water, their hooves splashing and their manes flowing in the wind. In the background, there is a body of water with some trees on the shore and some birds flying overhead. The sky is blue and there are some clouds in the distance. The brown horse is leading the way, with the white horse following closely behind. The overall feeling of the image is one of freedom and joy.
