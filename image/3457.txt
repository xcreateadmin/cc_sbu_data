This is an image of a person standing on a rocky beach with the ocean in the background. The person is standing with their back to the camera, looking out at the waves. They are wearing a black hoodie and black pants, and their hair is blowing in the wind. The beach is covered in large rocks and pebbles, and there are some small waves washing up onto the shore. The sky is a deep blue with some clouds, and the sun is setting behind the person, casting a warm orange glow on their back.
