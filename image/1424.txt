The image shows a clear glass tray with a black and white photograph of a woman's face on it. The photograph appears to be a close-up shot of the woman's face, with her eyes closed and her lips slightly parted. The tray is sitting on top of a black surface, which appears to be a table or counter. There is a small amount of clear liquid in the bottom of the glass.
