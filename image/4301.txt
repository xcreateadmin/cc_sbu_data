This The image shows a couple standing in a field of wheat, holding hands and looking into the distance. The man is wearing a white shirt and black pants, while the woman is wearing a white dress. The sky is cloudy and the sun is shining through the clouds, casting a warm light on the couple. The wheat stalks are tall and golden, swaying in the breeze. The couple is standing in the middle of the field, surrounded by the wheat on all sides. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the couple.
