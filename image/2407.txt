This image shows a dark room with two paintings hanging on the wall. The first painting is of a woman sitting on a chair with her legs crossed. The second painting is of a man sitting on a chair with his arms crossed. Both paintings are in shades of blue and gray. The walls of the room are made of wood and there is a small table with a vase of flowers on it in the corner of the room. The room is dimly lit with a few lamps on the walls.
