The image shows a small glass bottle filled with maple syrup. The bottle has a cork in the top and a wooden cap on the bottom. The maple syrup appears to be in liquid form and is a golden brown color. The bottle is clear and allows you to see the liquid inside. There is a small label on the side of the bottle with the words "Canadian Maple Syrup" written on it in white letters.
