This image shows an elephant standing in a shallow body of water at sunset. The elephant appears to be drinking from the water, and its trunk is submerged. The background is a grassy plain with trees in the distance. The sun is setting behind the elephant, casting a warm orange light on the animal and the area.

The elephant is a large mammal with gray skin and a long trunk. Its ears are large and flappy, and its eyes are small and black. The elephant's body is covered in wrinkles and folds of skin, and its legs are thick and muscular. The elephant's tail is long and thin, and it swings back and forth as the animal walks.

The water in which the elephant is standing is shallow, with only a few inches of water covering the ground.
