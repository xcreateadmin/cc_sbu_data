The painting depicts a scene from the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham is shown lying on the ground with his arm outstretched towards the sky, while his son Isaac kneels beside him with a knife in his hand. In the background, a mountainous landscape with trees and a river can be seen. The figures are dressed in biblical clothing. The overall mood of the painting is one of sadness and sacrifice.
