This image shows a bride and groom sitting in the back of a vintage car. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress with a long veil, and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black tie. They are both smiling and looking at each other. The car appears to be a classic convertible, with the top down and the wind blowing through the bride's hair. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a city street with buildings and trees in the distance.
