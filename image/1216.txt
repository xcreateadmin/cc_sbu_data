This is an image of a toilet with a child standing next to it. The toilet is white and has a tank on top and a bowl at the bottom. There is a handle on the side of the tank that is used to flush the toilet. The child appears to be reaching for something in the toilet, but it is not clear what they are reaching for. The room is a bathroom, as there is a sink and a shower in the background. The walls and floor are white and made of tile.
