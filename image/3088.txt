In this image, there are several dogs of different breeds, such as poodles, chihuahuas, golden retrievers, and dachshunds. They are all standing in the rain, with their tails wagging and their tongues hanging out. Some of the dogs are looking up at the sky, while others are looking down at the ground. The image is set against a blue sky with white clouds.
