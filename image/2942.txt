This is an image of a road construction site at night. The workers are wearing reflective vests and safety helmets, and they are using heavy machinery to lay down asphalt on the road. The light from the headlights of the machinery illuminates the area, casting long shadows on the workers and the equipment. The road is empty, and there are no cars or other vehicles in sight. The sky is clear, and the stars are visible in the background.
