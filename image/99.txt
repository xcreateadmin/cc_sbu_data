This is a black and white photograph of a woman carrying a small child on her back as they walk down a dirt road surrounded by trees. The woman is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, and the child is wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls. The woman is smiling, and the child is looking up at her with a happy expression. There are trees on either side of the road, and the sky is visible in the background.
