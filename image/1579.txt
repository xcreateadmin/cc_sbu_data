shows a steep cliff on the edge of a body of water that has been eroded by the ocean over time. A person wearing a black jacket and black pants is standing on the edge of the cliff, looking out at the water. There are plants growing on the edge of the cliff and the sky is clear and blue. Behind the person, there is a large expanse of deep blue water that stretches out to the horizon. In the distance, there are some clouds in the sky, but they are high up and do not obscure the view.
