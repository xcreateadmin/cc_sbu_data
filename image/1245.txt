This is a photograph of a cup of coffee and a muffin on a table. The coffee is in a white ceramic cup with a brown handle, while the muffin is on a plate next to the cup. There is a brown and white checkered napkin on the table next to them. A brown and white checkered box is also on the table in front of them, with a brown and white checkered label on it saying "seed and sprout" in brown letters. In front of the box, there is a brown and white checkered plate with a brown and white checkered fork, knife, and spoon on it.
