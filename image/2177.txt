The image depicts a German flag with a tricolor of black, red, and yellow on top of a building, with a city in the background. The flag has an eagle in the center with outspread wings and an open beak. It is waving due to the wind blowing from left to right. The sky is blue with white clouds, and the sun casts shadows on the ground. The image is clear, well-composed, and patriotic.
