The image shows a diagram of an association, which is a relationship between two or more objects in a system. The objects are represented by rectangles, and the relationship between them is represented by an arrow pointing from one object to another. There are three objects, labeled A, B, and C. Object A is associated with object B, and object B is associated with object C. This type of diagram is commonly used in object-oriented programming to represent the relationships between classes and objects in a system, and between different components in a system, such as hardware and software components.
