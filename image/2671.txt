This image shows a female volleyball player in action. She is wearing a purple jersey with the number 11 on the back and a pair of black shorts. Her hair is tied up in a ponytail and she is holding a volleyball in her right hand, ready to serve. In the background, there is a large crowd of people watching the game. Some of them are sitting in the stands, while others are standing along the sides of the court. There is a scoreboard in the background, but it is difficult to see what the score is. The lighting in the gym is bright, and there are several overhead lights shining down on the court. The floor is made of wood and appears to be in good condition.
