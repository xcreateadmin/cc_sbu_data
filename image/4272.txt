The image shows a large pile of books on a table, stacked on top of each other in various sizes and colors. Some books have titles on the spine while others do not. A woman standing next to the table, wearing a white shirt and black pants with her hair pulled back in a ponytail, is looking at the books. The background of the image appears to be a bookstore with shelves of books and other items visible.
