The image shows a view of the ocean from the top of a cliff at sunset. The sky is a mix of pink, orange, and purple as the sun sets behind the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the water. There are some clouds in the sky, but they are not very thick. The cliff is made of rocks and dirt, with plants growing on it. A small path leads down to the water's edge, where choppy waves crash against the shore. In the distance, a small island can be seen, along with some boats on the horizon.
