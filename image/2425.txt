This is a painting of a man in a small boat on a lake at sunset. The sun is setting behind the mountains in the distance and casting a warm orange glow on the water. The man is sitting in the boat with his back to the viewer, looking out over the water. There are some plants growing in the foreground, and a few birds can be seen flying overhead. The overall mood of the painting is peaceful and serene.
