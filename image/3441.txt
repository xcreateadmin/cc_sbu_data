The woman in the image is wearing a striped shawl, a pink top, and black pants while smiling and having her hands in her pockets. The shawl is made of a lightweight material, possibly cotton or silk, with thin and evenly spaced stripes. The color scheme of the shawl is predominantly white with black and pink accents. Her hair is styled in loose, wavy curls that fall just below her shoulders, and she is wearing minimal makeup with a hint of pink on her cheeks and lips. The woman is also wearing a pair of oversized sunglasses in a dark shade that complements her pink top. The image's background is a white marble column with ornate carvings.
