The image is a black and white illustration of a rock and roll hand gesture, with the words'rock and roll will never die'written in bold red letters above it. The hand gesture is formed by the index, middle and ring fingers being held up in the air, with the thumb and pinky fingers extended downwards. The image has a vintage, grungy feel to it, with a distressed texture and a gritty, grainy appearance. It could be used as a logo or graphic element for a rock and roll themed product or event, such as a concert poster, t shirt or album cover.
