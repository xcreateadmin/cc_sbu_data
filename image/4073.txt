There are two boys standing on a dock, one is holding a fishing rod and the other is sitting on the edge of the dock with his feet dangling in the water. The sun is setting in the background and the sky is orange and pink. The water is calm and there are no waves. The dock is made of wood and has a railing on the side. The boys are wearing blue shirts and shorts.
