This image is a representation of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of the Sacrifice. The holiday commemorates the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismail as an act of obedience to Allah.

The image shows a mosque with a crescent moon and star on top, surrounded by colorful decorations and lights. The words "Eid Mubarak" are written in Arabic script at the top of the image.

Inside the mosque, a group of people is gathered for the Eid prayer, dressed in their best clothes and holding hands in a sign of unity. In the foreground, there is a table with traditional Eid food, including sweets and fruits.
