There are several bison in the image, ranging in size from small calves to large adults. They have shaggy brown fur and large heads with distinctive humps on their backs. Some of the bison are standing on their hind legs, while others are lying down or grazing on the grass.

The lake is surrounded by lush green forest, with tall pine trees and other types of foliage visible. The water is clear and reflects the trees and mountains in the background.
