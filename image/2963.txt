The image shows a group of people in blue shirts standing on the beach, looking out at the ocean. They are holding small turtles in their hands and appear to be releasing them into the water. The turtles are small and have a shell on their backs. The people in the image are smiling and seem happy to be releasing the turtles. The beach is sandy and there are some rocks in the water. The sky is clear and there are some clouds in the distance.
