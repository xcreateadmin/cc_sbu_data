This is an image of a periodic table with atomic numbers and mass numbers. Atomic numbers are the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom, which determines the element it belongs to. Mass numbers, on the other hand, are the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, with each element's atomic number and mass number listed below it. The elements are color-coded, with noble gases in pink, alkali metals in blue, alkaline earth metals in green, transition metals in yellow, lanthanides in purple, and actinides in brown.
