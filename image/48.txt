This is a photograph of a residential street with houses on either side and a car parked on the side of the road. The houses are all different colors and styles, some having red, white, or blue roofs. The road is narrow with no sidewalks. The sky is cloudy with dark clouds in the background.

A small white car with tinted windows is parked on the side of the road at an angle with one side facing the camera and the other side facing away.

Several houses are visible in the background with different colors, styles, and some with balconies or porches. A few trees are also visible.
