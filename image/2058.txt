The image shows a blue sign with white lettering that reads "residencial del sol" in the center. The sign is mounted on a white wall with a blue and white striped awning above it. The building behind the sign appears to be made of white stucco and has several windows with white shutters. There are several palm trees in front of the building, and a sidewalk runs along the front of the building.
