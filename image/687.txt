The image shows two cats, one is black and white and the other is grey and white. The black and white cat is laying on its back with its paws in the air, while the grey and white cat is sitting next to it with its head tilted to the side. Both cats have their eyes open and appear to be looking at the camera. The caption reads, `'do you want to know something funny? nope.'''
