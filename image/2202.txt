This is a diagram of a cross section of a plant cell, showing its different parts like the cell wall, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The cell wall is made up of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate consisting of long chains of glucose molecules. The cytoplasm is the cell's fluid that contains various organelles, including mitochondria and ribosomes. The nucleus, which is the central part of the cell, contains the DNA or genetic material.
