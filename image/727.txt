This is a photograph of a bedroom. The walls are painted white and there is a grey carpet on the floor. There is a large bed in the middle of the room with a yellow bedspread and white pillows. Two lamps are placed on either side of the bed, one of which is turned on. There is a door on the left and a window on the right. The room is well lit and appears to be clean and well kept.
