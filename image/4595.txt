This image shows a large flock of white seagulls flying over a calm body of water. The sky is cloudy and the sun is setting behind the mountains in the distance. There is a small island in the middle of the water with some trees on it. The birds are flying in a V formation, as if they are migrating south for the winter. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the birds as they fly overhead. The photographer used a wide angle lens to capture the entire flock in the frame.
