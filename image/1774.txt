The painting depicts a young girl wearing a white dress and curly brown hair sitting on the floor in front of a large window. The window overlooks a dark, snowy landscape. The girl appears to be lost in thought with a sad expression on her face. A large, ornate mirror hangs on the wall behind her, reflecting the girl's image. The room is dimly lit with only a small table lamp providing illumination. The painting's overall mood is one of sadness and introspection.
