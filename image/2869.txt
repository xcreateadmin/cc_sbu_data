This is an image of a chicken farm with rows of cages filled with chickens. The cages are made of metal bars and are stacked on top of each other in the shape of a pyramid. The chickens are all facing the same direction, looking out of their cages. The floor of the farm is made of concrete and there are no other objects visible in the image. The walls of the farm are made of metal and there are no windows or doors visible. The lighting in the farm appears to be artificial.
