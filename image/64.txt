The image shows a bulletin board with various items on it. At the top, there is a red and white sign that reads "Working Wall." Below the sign, there are several pieces of paper and posters pinned to the board. One poster has a drawing of a person with a speech bubble coming out of their mouth. Another poster has a quote that reads, "Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle." The board also has several notes and reminders pinned to it, including one that reads, "Don't let yesterday take up too much of today."
