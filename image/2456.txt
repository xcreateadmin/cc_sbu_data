This is an image of a person wearing a Batman costume. The person is wearing a black suit with a white bat symbol on the chest, and a black cape flowing behind them. The person's face is obscured by the mask, but you can see their eyes glowing red through the eye holes. The person is standing in front of a dark background, with a bright light shining behind them, creating a silhouette effect. They are holding their arms out to the sides, as if they are ready to fight or defend themselves. The image is in black and white, with the bat symbol and the light behind the person being the only colors present.
