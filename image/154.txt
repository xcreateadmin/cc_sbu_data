There are several types of cakes and desserts in the box. The cakes include chocolate, vanilla, carrot, and cheesecake. All cakes are covered in frosting and decorated with toppings like sprinkles, chocolate chips, and nuts. Additionally, the cakes have pieces of fruit such as grapes, strawberries, and blueberries arranged on top. The box sits on a white tablecloth with a knife and plate nearby.
