This is an image of two fish being cooked in a pan on top of a campfire. The fish appear to be fresh and whole, with their heads and tails intact. The pan is black and appears to be made of metal. There is smoke coming from the fire, and the flames are orange and yellow. The background is a sandy beach with some rocks and driftwood in the foreground. The sky is blue and there are some clouds in the distance.
