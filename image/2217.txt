This is a black and white drawing of a person sitting on a dock, looking out at a body of water with ducks swimming in it. The person is holding a fishing rod and appears to be waiting for a fish to bite. The sky is dark and stormy, with clouds and lightning in the background. The water is choppy and there are waves crashing against the shore. The dock is wooden and appears to be weathered and old. There are no other objects or people in the image.
