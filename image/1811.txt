The image shows a wooden gate with metal hinges leading into an overgrown garden. The gate is slightly open, revealing a glimpse of the garden beyond. In the background, there is a small white house with a green roof and white walls. Vines partially obscure a window on the side of the house. The image conveys a sense of neglect and decay.
