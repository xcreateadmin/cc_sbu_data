This is an illustration of various objects hanging from strings, with the words 'things that art' written above them. The objects depicted include a pair of scissors, a paintbrush, a pencil, and a piece of paper. The words are written in a stylized font, with each letter hanging from a different string. The overall effect is one of creativity and inspiration, as if the objects are there as a reminder to create something beautiful.
