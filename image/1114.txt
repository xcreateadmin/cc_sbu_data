The painting depicts a group of people on a boat in the middle of the ocean. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The people on the boat are dressed in period clothing, with some wearing hats and others holding onto ropes. In the foreground, there is a small rowboat with two people in it, heading towards the larger boat. The water is choppy, with waves crashing over the sides of the boat. The sky is filled with clouds, with the sun peeking out from behind them. The overall mood of the painting is one of adventure and exploration.
