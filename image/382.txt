This image shows a group of people standing in a boxing ring. Two men are boxing, one in a red shirt and black pants and the other in a white shirt and black pants, both wearing boxing gloves. There is a referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants, standing in the corner of the ring with a whistle in his mouth, watching the match closely. Several people are sitting in the stands, wearing different clothing and cheering on the fighters. The room is dimly lit and shadows can be seen on the walls.
