The image shows a person skiing down a steep snowy slope. The sun is shining brightly in the background, casting shadows on the snow. The person is wearing a helmet, goggles, and gloves, and is holding ski poles in their hands. There is a large bubble coming out of the person's mouth, and it looks like they are blowing it. The slope is covered in fresh snow, and there are some trees visible in the distance.
