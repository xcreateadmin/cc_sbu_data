The image displays the Sydney skyline at night, featuring the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background. The bridge is illuminated with blue and white lights, and is a significant symbol of the city. The steel arch bridge serves as an important transportation link, connecting the north and south shores of Sydney. A concrete pier with a metal railing extends from the foreground into the harbour, with a few boats docked to it, and their lights reflecting in the water.
