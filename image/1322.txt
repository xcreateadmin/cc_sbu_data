The image is a pencil drawing of a woman's head with long, straight hair. The hair is drawn in pencil with shading and highlights to give it a realistic look. The woman's face is not shown, but the hair is drawn in great detail, with strands of hair hanging down from the top of her head. There is a pencil next to the drawing, which is used to create the image.
