This is a black and white drawing of a city skyline. The skyline is made up of several tall buildings with many windows and balconies. The buildings are all different shapes and sizes, with some of them being taller than others. There are also some trees and other greenery in the foreground. In the background, there is a body of water with some boats on it and mountains partially obscured by clouds. The overall effect of the image is one of a bustling, vibrant city with a mix of old and new architecture.
