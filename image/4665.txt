This is an image of a dark room with a large glass wall that looks out onto a brightly lit cityscape at night. The room is empty except for a few chairs and a reception desk with a computer on it. The walls are painted a dark blue and there are several light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. The floor is made of shiny black tiles. There is a large window on one side of the room that looks out onto the city.
