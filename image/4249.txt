The image shows a science fair project display board with several different components. At the top of the board, there is an image of a volcano with the words "Properties of Rocks" written underneath it. On the left side of the board, there is a list of different types of rocks, including sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. In the center of the board, there is an illustration of a rock cycle with arrows pointing from sedimentary to metamorphic and then to igneous. On the right side of the board, there is an illustration of a volcano with different parts labeled, including the crater, the lava flow, and the ash plume. There are also some additional notes and diagrams on the board, including a chart showing the different types of rocks and their properties, and a diagram of the rock cycle.
