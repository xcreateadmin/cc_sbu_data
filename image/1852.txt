This image appears to be a greeting card with a cartoon image of three birds standing on a windowsill, looking out the window. One of the birds has a star above its head and is pointing to something outside the window. The other two birds are looking at the bird with the star, as if they're trying to figure out what it's pointing at. The image is colorful and playful, with a lot of detail in the birds'feathers and the window frame.
