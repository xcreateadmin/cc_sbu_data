This image shows a woman sitting at a sewing machine in a quilting store. The woman is wearing a red apron and is working on a piece of fabric that is spread out on the table in front of her. There are several other pieces of fabric and quilting supplies scattered around the room. The walls are lined with shelves that are filled with more fabric, thread, and other quilting supplies. There is a large window behind the woman that lets in a lot of natural light. The room appears to be well lit and well organized, with everything in its place.
