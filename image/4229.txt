The person is wearing traditional clothing and has a serene expression on their face. Behind the statue, there is a group of people standing on the other side of the stairs, looking at the statue and taking pictures.

The image is taken from a low angle, with bright lighting casting shadows on the surrounding area. The background is a blur, with people and buildings visible in the distance. The statue takes up most of the frame and the people provide context.
