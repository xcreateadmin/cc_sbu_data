This image is a black and white photograph of a man wearing a baseball cap and holding his hands up to his face, as if he's covering his eyes. The man's face is obscured by shadows, but you can see the outline of his features. The background of the image appears to be a dark, solid color. There are no other visible objects or elements in the image, except for the man's hands and the baseball cap he's wearing.
