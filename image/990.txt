The image shows a group of birds perched on a wire fence, with palm trees in the background. The fence appears to be made of metal and has a diamond pattern. The birds are perched on the top of the fence, with their wings spread out, and some have their beaks open. The sky is clear and blue with a few fluffy clouds visible, and there is a small building in the distance with a red roof and white walls.
