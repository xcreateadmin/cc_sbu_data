This is an image of a small bird with white and black feathers swimming in a body of water. It has a long, thin beak and appears to be swimming towards the right side of the image, possibly attempting to catch something in the water. The sky is light blue with some clouds, and there are ripples in the water around the bird. The reflection of the bird and the water can be seen in the surface of the water.
