The image shows a group of children and adults standing in front of bookshelves in a library. They are all smiling and holding up a large banner that reads, "Read Across America." Some of the children are holding books, while others are holding up signs that say things like "Reading is Fun" and "Love to Read." The adults in the photo are also smiling and holding up signs that say things like "Reading is the Key to Success" and "Reading is Power." The overall atmosphere of the photo is one of joy and excitement about reading.
