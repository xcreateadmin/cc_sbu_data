The image shows a pair of eels swimming in the ocean. The eels are brown in color and have long, slender bodies with small heads and large eyes. They appear to be swimming in a school, with one eel leading the way and the other following closely behind. The background of the image is a mix of rocks, coral, and sand, with various fish and other sea creatures visible in the distance. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene.
