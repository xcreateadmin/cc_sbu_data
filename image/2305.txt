This image shows a display of olives at a market. The olives are displayed in trays and are labeled with prices. They are a mix of green and purple and appear ripe for consumption. Various types of olives are present, including pitted and unpitted varieties, arranged in a grid pattern on the trays with some stacked on top of each other. The trays are stacked on top of each other, making it easy to see all of the olives at once. The display is set up outside, possibly at a farmer's market or grocery store, where other produce is also being sold in the background.
