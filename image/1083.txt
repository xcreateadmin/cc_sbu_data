The image shows a view of the twelve apostles rock formations on the great ocean road in Australia. The cliffs are tall and rocky, jutting out into the deep blue ocean under a clear and sunny sky without any clouds. The cliffs are covered in green vegetation and some small plants grow on the ground. There are no people in the image. The apostles are a popular tourist attraction, visited by millions of people each year, and are a testament to the power of erosion and the forces of nature. They remind us of the beauty and majesty of the natural world and are a must-see for anyone visiting Australia.
