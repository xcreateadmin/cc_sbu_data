This image is a photograph of a white bowl filled with a salad made up of a variety of greens, including romaine lettuce, red radishes, and thin slices of red onion. The bowl is sitting on top of a wooden table with a white tablecloth. There is a fork and knife in the bowl, as well as a sprig of fresh rosemary on the side of the bowl. The overall color scheme of the image is bright and fresh, with the green of the lettuce and radishes contrasting with the white of the bowl and tablecloth.
