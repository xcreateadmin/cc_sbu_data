The image shows a row of old and weathered wooden barrels stacked on top of each other in a dimly lit room made of stone walls. There is a small window on one side of the room that lets in some light. The floor is made of dirt or gravel and there is a small puddle of water on the ground. The overall mood of the image is dark and mysterious.
