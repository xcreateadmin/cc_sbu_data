This image shows a garage with several cars parked inside. The walls are made of brick and the floor is made of concrete. There are two large windows on one side of the garage and a door on the other side. The cars are parked in a row, with a red car in the front and a black car in the back. There are several other cars parked in the garage, but they are not visible in this image. The garage appears to be well lit and well kept.
