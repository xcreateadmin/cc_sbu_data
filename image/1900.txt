This is an image of a kitchen with dark wood cabinets and countertops. There is a large island in the center of the room with a marble countertop and a wine rack on top. The floors are a light colored hardwood and there is a large window above the sink that lets in a lot of natural light. The walls are painted a neutral color and there is a large chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
