The image shows a large, ancient temple in the middle of a desert. The temple is made of stone and has several columns and arches. The sky is clear and blue. The temple appears to be very old and has been standing for a long time. It has a large front entrance with two columns on either side, made of stone and intricately carved. The temple is surrounded by sand and dirt, giving it a sense of isolation.
