The image shows a group of people standing in front of a green banner with the words "Northwestern University" written on it. They are all smiling and holding a trophy. The people in the image are dressed in formal attire, with men wearing suits and women wearing dresses. The trophy appears to be made of metal and has an engraved plaque on it that reads "Northwestern University Women's Volleyball Team, 2019 National Champions."
