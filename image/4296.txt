The room is decorated with wooden furniture, including a king size bed, nightstands, and lamps. The walls are painted in a light color, and there are large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The floors are made of wooden planks, and there is a rug on the floor. There is a large balcony with outdoor furniture, including a table and chairs. The view from the balcony is breathtaking, with the ocean stretching out as far as the eye can see.
