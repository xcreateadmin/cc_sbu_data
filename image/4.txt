The image shows a group of people walking down a sidewalk, holding signs that read `get scientific right'. They are wearing red shirts and carrying banners with the same message. The people in the image appear to be young adults and children, and they are walking in a line, with some people in front and some behind. The image is taken from a distance, so it's difficult to see their faces, but it's clear that they are all holding up their signs and walking in the same direction. The background of the image is a residential neighborhood with trees and houses visible in the distance.
