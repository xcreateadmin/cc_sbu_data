This is an image of two clay pots sitting on the grass in a field. The pots are old and weathered, with cracks and chips in the clay. One of the pots is lying on its side, while the other is standing upright. The image is taken from a low angle, with the grass and weeds in the foreground and the pots in the background. The sky is cloudy and overcast, casting a dull light over the scene. In the center of the image, there is a quote from Proverbs 24:27, which reads, `'All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.' This quote emphasizes the importance of working hard and putting in the effort to achieve success, rather than just talking about it without taking action. The quote is written in a simple, sans - serif font, with the words `Proverbs 24:27' written in a smaller font underneath.
