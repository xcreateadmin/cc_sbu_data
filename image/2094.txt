The image shows a group of three white statues, each depicting a woman in a different pose. The first statue is of a woman standing with her arms outstretched, as if she is embracing someone. The second statue is of a woman sitting on a bench, with her hands resting on her lap. The third statue is of a woman standing with her hands on her hips, looking off into the distance. All three statues are made of white marble and have intricate details, such as the folds in the women's clothing and the veins in their arms. There is a potted plant and some flowers in the foreground of the image.
