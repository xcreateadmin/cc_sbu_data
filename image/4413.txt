In the image, there is a mason jar filled with a liquid substance, which seems to be a mixture of water and some kind of powder or crystalline substance. There is a small amount of red liquid floating on top of it. The jar has a label on the side that reads "snow globe" in white letters. In the background, there are green pine branches with red and white ornaments hanging from them.
