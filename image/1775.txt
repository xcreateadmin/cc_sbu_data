This is a salad with roasted beets, orange slices, goat cheese, walnuts, and a vinaigrette dressing. The beets are sliced and roasted to give them a sweet, caramelized flavor. The orange slices are thinly sliced and placed on top of the beets. The goat cheese is crumbled on top of the salad, and the walnuts are chopped and sprinkled on top. The vinaigrette dressing is made with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. The salad is served in a white bowl with a fork on the side.
