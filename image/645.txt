The image shows two tote bags with colorful designs on them. One bag has the words 'happy birthday' written on it in pink letters, while the other has the words 'sweet baby' written on it in blue letters. Both bags have large bows on them, one pink and the other blue. The bags are on top of a wooden surface, which appears to be a table or easel. There are various colors and shapes of paintbrushes and art supplies scattered around.
