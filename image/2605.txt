The image shows a large, stone building with arched windows and a tall, pointed roof. The building is surrounded by green grass and trees, and there is a sidewalk leading up to the entrance. The walls of the building are made of large, rough stones, and there are two small windows on either side of the door. The door is made of wood and has a large, ornate knob in the center. The building appears to be very old and has a lot of character.
