This is a photo of a bookstore. The walls are painted white and there are shelves of books on the walls, filled with a variety of books, including fiction, nonfiction, and children's books. The floor is made of tiles and there is a carpeted area in the center of the room. The room is well lit with overhead lights and floor lamps on the shelves. There is a large window on one wall that lets in a lot of natural light. Two people are in the photo, one standing by the window and the other in front of the shelves.
