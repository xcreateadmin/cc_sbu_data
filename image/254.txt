The image shows a row of red scooters parked on the side of a narrow street with buildings on either side. The scooters are lined up in a row, with some parked on the sidewalk and others parked on the street. The buildings on either side of the street are old and made of brick, with balconies and shutters on the windows. The street is lined with cobblestones, and there are no cars or other vehicles in sight. The sky is clear and blue, with a few fluffy clouds in the distance.
