The image shows a sculpture of a bull made of metal and brown in color standing on its hind legs in front of a building. The bull has a large head and horns, and a muscular body. The sculpture is located in a city square with tall buildings in the background, and people walking around, some of whom are looking at the bull. The overall impression is one of strength and power, with the bull standing tall and proud in the center of the square.
