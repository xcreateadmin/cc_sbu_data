This image shows a large cargo ship with a red hull and white containers stacked on its deck. The ship is docked in a harbor with a large body of water in the background. Several people are standing on the ship's deck, some wearing orange overalls and hard hats. The ship appears to be loading or unloading cargo from the containers.
