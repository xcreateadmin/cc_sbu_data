This image shows a group of children playing in a fountain in the middle of a city square. The fountain is made up of several jets of water that are spraying up into the air. The children are wearing yellow shirts and shorts, and they are laughing and splashing each other as they play in the water. In the background, there are several buildings with balconies and windows, and there are people walking by on the sidewalks. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in the sky.
