This image shows a baseball pitcher in a red and gray uniform with the number 40 on the back, holding a baseball in his right hand on the mound during a game. The catcher is crouched behind the plate, and the umpire is standing behind the catcher. In the background, you can see other players on the field, including the infielders and outfielders. It appears to be a sunny day with no clouds in the sky. This is a professional baseball game from the 1970s or 1980s.
