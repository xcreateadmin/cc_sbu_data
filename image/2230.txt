This is an abstract painting depicting a landscape with a body of water in the foreground and mountains in the background. The sky is a gradient of blue, green, and white with clouds in the distance. The water is a deep blue with ripples. The mountains are painted in shades of green and brown with trees visible on the slopes. The composition is well-balanced, with the water taking up about a third of the canvas, and the mountains taking up the other two thirds. The color scheme is soothing and calming, with blue and green tones creating a sense of serenity. The loose and expressive brushstrokes give the painting a sense of movement and energy. The overall effect is tranquil and peaceful.
