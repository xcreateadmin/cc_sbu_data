This is a black and white photograph of a man in a military uniform holding a baby in his arms. The man is wearing a white hat and the baby is wearing a white bonnet. They are standing outside in front of a building with other people in the background.

The man is holding the baby with one arm and the other arm is resting on the baby's shoulder. The baby is looking up at the man with a happy expression on its face. The man is smiling and looking down at the baby. There are other people standing in the background, but it's difficult to make out their faces.
