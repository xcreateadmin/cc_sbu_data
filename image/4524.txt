This is an image of a farmer plowing a field with two oxen. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The farmer is dressed in traditional clothing and is wearing a hat to protect himself from the sun. The oxen are pulling the plow through the dirt road, creating furrows in the soil. The field is lush and green, with crops growing in rows. There are trees on either side of the field, providing shade for the farmer and his animals. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene, with a sense of hard work and dedication to the land.
