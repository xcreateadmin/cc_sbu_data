This image shows a tree with a bird perched on its branches. The bird is sitting on the top of the tree, with its wings spread out and its beak open. The tree is a large, leafy one with a thick trunk and branches that stretch out in all directions. In the background, there is a body of water with mountains in the distance. The sky is clear and blue, with a few fluffy clouds floating in it. The bird appears to be a raptor with dark feathers on its back and wings, lighter feathers on its chest and belly, sharp talons, and a hooked beak. Some of the leaves on the tree partially obscure the bird's body.
