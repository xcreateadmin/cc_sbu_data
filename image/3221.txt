This image is a tattoo on the right leg of a person. The tattoo is written in black ink and reads, `so glad you are'. The words are written in a cursive font and are positioned on the outside of the leg, just above the ankle. The tattoo appears to be new and well done, with clean lines and even spacing between the letters. The overall design of the tattoo is simple and elegant.
