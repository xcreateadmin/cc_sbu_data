This The image shows a group of pink tulips in a large planter on a stone patio. The tulips are in full bloom, with their petals open and facing upwards. The flowers are arranged in a curved pattern, with some of them leaning over the edge of the planter. In the background, there is a stone fountain with water flowing out of it. The fountain has a large, round bowl at the top and a narrow spout at the bottom. There are several trees in the background, with their branches reaching up towards the sky. The overall effect of the image is one of tranquility and beauty.
