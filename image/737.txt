The image shows a group of people walking down a snowy sidewalk in front of a red brick building. The people are dressed in winter clothing, including hats, scarves, and coats. Some of them are carrying backpacks and other bags, while others have their hands in their pockets. In the background, there are several trees with snow on their branches, and a few cars parked on the street. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with no sun in sight.
