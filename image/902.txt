This image shows a bride and groom walking through an olive grove at sunset. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo. They are holding hands and looking at each other with smiles on their faces. The sun is setting behind them, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The trees in the background are tall and thin with changing leaves for the fall. The ground is covered with dry leaves and twigs, and there is a dirt path that leads through the grove.
