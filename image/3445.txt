This image is a photograph of a building with a window and a balcony on the second floor. The building is made of beige bricks and has a brown roof. The window is made of metal bars and has a wooden frame. There is a small balcony on the second floor with a metal railing. The building appears to be old and in disrepair, with cracks in the bricks and peeling paint on the walls. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the building.
