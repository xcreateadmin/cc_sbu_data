This is an image of the human brain. The brain controls the body's functions, including movement, sensation, perception, and behavior. It is made up of several parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The cerebrum is the largest part, divided into two hemispheres. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. The brainstem controls automatic functions like breathing and heart rate. </s>
