This image shows a wedding ceremony taking place in a large room with a long aisle lined with chairs. The aisle is decorated with flowers and there are two large windows on either side of the room, letting in natural light. The bride and groom are standing at the end of the aisle, facing each other and holding hands. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo. The guests are seated in the chairs and watching the ceremony. On the wall behind the bride and groom, there is a large banner with the words 'I remember this day forever and always' written on it.
