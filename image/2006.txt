This is a black and white photograph of an old, abandoned church in the middle of a foggy field. The church is made of wood and has a steeple on top. The windows are boarded up and the door is hanging off its hinges. The surrounding area is covered in tall grass and there are no trees in sight. The sky is cloudy and overcast, giving the scene a gloomy, eerie feel.
