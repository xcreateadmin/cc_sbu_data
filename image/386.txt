This is a black and white photograph of a man and woman standing under a tree in the snow. The man is holding the woman's hand and they are both looking at something in the distance. There is a streetlight in the background, casting a warm glow on the couple. The snow is falling heavily, covering the ground and the branches of the tree. The couple is dressed in winter clothing, with the man wearing a hat and scarf and the woman wearing a coat and boots.
