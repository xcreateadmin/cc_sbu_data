This is a photograph of a group of people in a yoga class. They are sitting on mats on the floor, with their legs stretched out in front of them. The instructor is leading the class through a series of poses. The room is well lit with natural light coming from large windows. There are a few pieces of yoga equipment visible in the background such as blocks and straps.
