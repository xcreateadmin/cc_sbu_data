This image shows a display of Heineken beer cans stacked in a pyramid shape in a well-lit supermarket. The cans are all the same size and have the Heineken logo on them, which is a green and white shield with the words Heineken written on it in white letters. The cans are green and white, and the display is arranged with the largest cans at the bottom and the smallest cans at the top. The supermarket sells food and household items and has many shelves and aisles filled with products. The walls are painted white, and the floor is made of tiles.
