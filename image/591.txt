This image shows a pile of old rope made up of several strands twisted and knotted together. Some strands are frayed and broken, while others are still intact. The rope appears to be made of natural fibers such as hemp or jute and is covered in dirt and debris. A small amount of green twine is wrapped around the base of the pile, giving it an overall effect of neglect and abandonment.
