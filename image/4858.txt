There are different types of pastries on display in a clear glass case in a bakery or pastry shop. The pastries include cinnamon rolls, croissants, and muffins, and they appear freshly baked and still warm with steam rising from them. Above the case is a sign that reads "freshly baked pastries" in large letters.
