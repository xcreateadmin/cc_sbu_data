The image shows a man in a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black tie, wearing a black bow tie and standing on a red carpet in front of a wall with the words '2019 NHL Awards' written on it in white letters. Other people can be seen in the background, but the main focus is on the man in the tuxedo.
