This is a black and white photograph of a woman standing in front of a brick wall. She is wearing a white shirt and black pants, and has her arms crossed in front of her chest. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she has a serious expression on her face. The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman from below her waist. There is a small amount of grain visible in the image, but it does not detract from the overall quality of the photograph. The image is well composed, with the woman standing in the center of the frame and the brick wall providing an interesting background.
