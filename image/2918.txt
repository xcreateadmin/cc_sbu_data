This image is a tea towel with a quote on it that reads, `'People who love to eat are always the best people.' The quote is written in white letters on a beige background. The tea towel appears to be made of a soft, absorbent material, such as cotton or linen. The edges of the towel are likely finished with a hem or fold to prevent fraying. The overall design of the towel is simple and clean, with the quote standing out against the neutral background.
