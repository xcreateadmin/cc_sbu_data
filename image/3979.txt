This image shows a small pug dog standing on a gray background. The pug has a black collar around its neck and is looking up at the camera with a curious expression. Its fur is short and smooth, and its eyes are brown. The muzzle is long and the ears are floppy. The body is compact and the legs are short, while the tail is long and curled upwards. The pug appears to be in good health and well-groomed.
