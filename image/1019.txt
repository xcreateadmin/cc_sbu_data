The image shows a residential area with houses on either side of the road. A fence separates the road from the well-maintained grassy area in front of the houses. The houses have white walls and red roofs, some even have balconies or patios. Trees on either side of the road provide shade to the houses, and a few cars are parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and cloudless.
