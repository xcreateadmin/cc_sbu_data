There are several rows of seats in the dining car, each with a table in front of them. The seats are upholstered in a light beige color with red and blue accents on the armrests. The tables are made of wood and have white tablecloths on them. There is a large window behind the seats that lets in natural light. The walls are painted in a light gray color and there are several light fixtures hanging from the ceiling.
