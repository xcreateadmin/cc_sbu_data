This is a sleeve tattoo of a raven. The raven is a black bird with red accents on its wings and beak, perched on a branch with its wings spread out and beak open. The tattoo is done in a realistic style with emphasis on the feathers and bird's anatomy, possibly representing personal transformation or a tribute to someone who has passed away.
