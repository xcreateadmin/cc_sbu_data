This is a black and white photograph of a large rock formation in the middle of a grassy field. The rock formation is made up of several large boulders stacked on top of each other, with some smaller rocks scattered around the base. There are no trees or other vegetation visible in the photograph. The sky is cloudy and overcast. The tallest boulder reaches up to about 20 feet high. The boulders and smaller rocks are irregularly shaped, with some stacked haphazardly. The overall impression of the photograph is one of ruggedness and natural beauty, with the elements slowly eroding away at the formation over time.
