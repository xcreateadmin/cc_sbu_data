The image is a painting of the Indian flag on a cracked surface. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes - saffron on top, white in the middle, and green at the bottom. The flag has the Ashoka Chakra at its center, which is a 24-spoked wheel in navy blue and symbolizes the nation's independence and sovereignty.
