There are two cocktail glasses on a tray, one with a yellow liquid and the other with a green liquid. Two bottles of alcohol are on the table, one with a green label and the other with a pink label. There are two straws in the drinks, one with a green tip and the other with a yellow tip. Two sprigs of mint are on the tray, one on each side of the drinks. The background is a floral pattern on a white tablecloth.
