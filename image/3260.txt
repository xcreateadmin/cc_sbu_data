There are two plates on the table, each with a waffle on it. The waffles appear to be plain, with no toppings or syrup on them. The plates are white and have the words "waffle" written on them in black ink. The waffles appear to be freshly made, as the steam is still rising from them. There is a knife on the table next to the plates, which could be used to cut the waffles into smaller pieces. The background of the image is a stainless steel countertop, with a sink and some cleaning supplies visible in the background.
