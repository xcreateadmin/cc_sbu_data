This image shows a group of rocks and minerals. The rocks are made up of different types of minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. These minerals are often found in igneous rocks, which form from the solidification and crystallization of molten magma or lava. The rocks in this image are likely to be metamorphic, which form from the alteration of preexisting rocks due to high pressure and temperature. The texture and color of the rocks indicate that they have undergone significant changes from their original form.
