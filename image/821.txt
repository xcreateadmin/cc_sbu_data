This is an image of a bartender pouring a cocktail made with vodka, lime juice, and ice into a clear glass. The bartender is wearing a white shirt with black sleeves and a black apron and is holding a stainless steel cocktail shaker with a black handle in their right hand. The drink is garnished with a lemon wedge and a thin slice of lemon on the rim of the glass. The background is a wooden bar with a black countertop and shelves of liquor bottles behind the bartender.
