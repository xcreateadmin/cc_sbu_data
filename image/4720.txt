This is a black and white photograph of a large body of water with choppy waves. The sky is cloudy and the sun is shining through the clouds, casting shadows on the water. There are no boats or other objects visible in the photograph. The water appears to be quite rough, with the waves crashing against the shore. The shore is not visible in this photograph, but it appears to be rocky and jagged. The horizon is not visible in this photograph, but it appears to be quite far away.
