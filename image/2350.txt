The image shows a classroom decorated for Christmas. There is a fireplace with stockings hanging from the mantle, a Christmas tree with presents underneath it, and various other decorations such as wreaths, garlands, and bows. The walls are adorned with red and green banners that say "Merry Christmas" in white letters. The floor has a red and green checkerboard pattern. There are two windows on either side of the room, each with a wreath hanging from the sill.
