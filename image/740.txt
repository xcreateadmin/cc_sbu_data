This is a diagram of a formal plot of a story. It shows the rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution of the story. The rising action is the beginning of the story, where the characters are introduced and the conflict is established. The climax is the turning point of the story, where the conflict is at its highest point and the outcome is uncertain. The falling action is the part of the story after the climax, where the conflict is resolved and the outcome is determined. The resolution is the ending of the story, where the loose ends are tied up and the story comes to a close. This diagram is a useful tool for visualizing the structure of a story and identifying its key elements.
