There are three small glass bottles sitting on top of a wooden block. Each bottle is filled with a different type of liquid. The first bottle is filled with a clear liquid, the second bottle is filled with a yellow liquid, and the third bottle is filled with a brown liquid. All three bottles have corks in them and are sitting on top of a white marble surface.
