This image features a white sweatshirt with the phrase "and like a good neighbor, stay over there" written in black letters on the front. The phrase is a play on words from a popular saying used during the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage people to maintain distance from their neighbors. It is written in bold font and centered on the chest of the sweatshirt. The sweatshirt has a round neckline, long sleeves, and is made of a thin and lightweight material.
