This image shows a large, colorful barrel made of metal sitting on the ground in front of a brick wall with graffiti on it. The barrel is covered in various colors of spray paint. There is a chain link fence in the background, also with graffiti on it. The tone of the image is gritty and urban, with a sense of decay and abandonment.
