The image shows a woman standing in front of a fence, looking at a plant in a pot on the other side of the fence. There is a thought bubble above the woman's head with a speech bubble coming out of it that says, "I don't know what to do." The woman is wearing a pink shirt and black pants, and she has short brown hair. The fence is made of wooden planks and has a gate in the middle. The plant in the pot is a small flower with pink and white petals. The background is a pink and orange gradient.
