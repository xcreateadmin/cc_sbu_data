The image shows a black table with a glass of water and a straw on it. The table is on a wooden floor and there is a window in the background.

The glass of water is clear and has a straw sticking out of it. The table appears to be made of metal or plastic and has a round shape with a flat surface. The surface of the table is smooth and there are no visible scratches or marks on it.

The window in the background is made of glass and has a wooden frame. The frame is rectangular in shape and has a white color. The glass of the window is clear and allows light to pass through it. There are no curtains or blinds covering the window, so it is possible to see outside.

There are no other objects visible in the image except for the table, glass of water, and straw. The background is blurry and it is difficult to see what is behind the table
