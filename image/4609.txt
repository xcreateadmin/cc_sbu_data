The image shows a white house with two stories and a balcony on the top floor. The house is located on a hillside with a view of the valley below. The sun is setting behind the mountains in the distance, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The windows of the house are open, allowing the breeze to flow through. There is a balcony on the top floor with a railing and a small table with a vase of flowers on it. The roof of the house has several skylights that let in natural light. The overall feeling of the image is peaceful and serene, with the sun setting over the mountains providing a beautiful backdrop.
