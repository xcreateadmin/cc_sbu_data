This is a photograph of a factory floor with several women working at sewing machines. The women are wearing aprons and gloves, and they are working on various pieces of clothing. There are several piles of fabric and other materials on the tables in front of them. The walls are made of brick and there are windows on either side of the room. The floor is made of wooden planks and there are several machines and other equipment scattered around the room. The overall atmosphere is one of industry and hard work.
