This is an image of a small brown mouse peeking out of a hole in a wall. The mouse is standing on its hind legs with its front paws resting on the edge of the hole. The wall behind the mouse has a pattern of blue and white flowers on it. The floor appears to be made of wood or some other natural material. There is a small amount of light coming in from the right side of the image, casting a shadow on the wall and the mouse. The overall mood of the image is cute and cozy.
