This image depicts a wolf standing on a rock in front of a full moon. The wolf's eyes are glowing in the light of the moon, and its fur is ruffled in the wind. The wolf appears to be howling at the moon. In the foreground, there are trees and bushes, and in the background, there is a mountain range with a waterfall. The overall mood of the image is one of mystery and awe.
