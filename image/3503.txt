It is the largest of the terrestrial planets in our solar system and the fifth largest in the Milky Way galaxy, with a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers and a mass of about 5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases, while its surface is divided into several layers, including the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, composed of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks, while the mantle is the layer beneath the crust.
