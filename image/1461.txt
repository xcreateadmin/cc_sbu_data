This is a black and white photograph of a bride standing in front of a group of women. The bride is wearing a white wedding dress and has her hair styled in an updo. She is smiling and holding her bouquet of flowers. The other women in the photograph are also smiling and appear to be family members or friends of the bride. They are all standing in front of a wooden building with a large window. The building appears to be a barn or other outdoor structure.
