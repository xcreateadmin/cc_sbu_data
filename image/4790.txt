This image depicts a statue of a baseball player standing in front of a stadium. The player is holding a bat and appears to be in the middle of a swing. The statue is made of bronze and stands on a pedestal in front of the stadium's entrance. The stadium's name is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a large, modern facility with glass walls and a metal roof. There are no people visible in the image, but there are several cars parked in front of the stadium.
