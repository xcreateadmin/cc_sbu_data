The painting depicts a landscape with a river running through it, with trees on either side. The sky is dark and stormy, with clouds and lightning in the distance. In the foreground, there is a woman standing on the bank of the river, looking out at the storm. Behind her, there is a man standing on a bridge, looking out at the storm as well. In the background, there are mountains and more trees, with the stormy sky continuing into the distance.
