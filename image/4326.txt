This image shows a close-up view of a small bowl of saffron, a spice commonly used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine. The bowl is made of metal and has a small handle on the side. Some of the saffron spills out of the bowl onto the wooden table. There is a small spoon next to the bowl that appears to have been used to scoop some of the saffron out. Other small bowls and containers are visible on the table.
