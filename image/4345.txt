This is a black and white photograph of a single-story house on a street corner. The house has a pitched roof and white siding. Two trees are in the front yard, one on either side of the driveway. The street is empty, with no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is clear and blue with a few fluffy clouds visible in the distance.
