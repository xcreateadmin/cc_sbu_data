The image shows a bouquet of red tulips with butterflies flying around them on a green background. The tulips are in full bloom and have bright red petals with yellow centers. There are several butterflies flying around the flowers, with their wings open and their bodies glistening in the sunlight. The flowers are arranged in a loose, casual style, with some stems hanging down and others standing upright. The overall effect is one of freshness and beauty, with the vibrant colors of the tulips and butterflies providing a striking contrast to the green background.
