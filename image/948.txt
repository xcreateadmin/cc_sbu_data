This image shows a white wedding dress with lace detailing on the bodice and skirt hanging on a wooden rack in a dimly lit room with wooden beams. The strapless gown has a sweetheart neckline and is made of a delicate, sheer material. Light is coming in from the windows and chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The room has white walls and a wooden plank floor with a rug in front of the dress.
