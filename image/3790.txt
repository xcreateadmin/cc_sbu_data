The woman in the image is standing on a tree stump in the middle of a river. She is wearing a black cloak and has long, dark hair that falls down her back. Her eyes are brown and she has a small smile on her face. The water in the river is clear and you can see fish swimming in it. There are trees on both sides of the river and some reeds growing in the water. The sky is cloudy and it looks like it might rain soon.
