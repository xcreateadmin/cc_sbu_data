This image shows a group of people working on a roof in a residential area. They are wearing protective gear, including hard hats, gloves, and safety vests, and carrying tools such as hammers, nails, and saws. The roof appears to be made of asphalt shingles. A ladder is leaning against the side of the house, and some workers are standing on the roof while others are working on the ground. Other houses are visible in the background.
