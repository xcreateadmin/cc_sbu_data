The image shows a body of water at sunset. The sky is a bright blue with a few clouds in the distance. The water is calm and reflects the sky. There are rocks on the shore and in the water. The horizon line is low and the sun is setting behind the trees on the left side of the image. There is a sense of peace and tranquility in the scene.
