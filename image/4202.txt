The image shows three bags of coffee beans labeled with different types of coffee beans, such as Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Guatemalan Antigua, and Sumatran Mandheling. The coffee beans appear to be of high quality and are packaged in clear, resealable bags. There is a pen and notepad next to the bags, suggesting that the image is meant to be used as a promotional material for a coffee company.
