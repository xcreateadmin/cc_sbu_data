The painting depicts the ruins of an ancient temple on a hill overlooking a lake at sunset. The temple is in a state of disrepair, with crumbling columns and broken pediments. The sky is a vibrant orange and pink at sunset, with clouds in the distance. The water in the lake is calm and reflects the sky. There are no people or animals in the scene.
