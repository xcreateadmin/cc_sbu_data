This The image shows a group of people posing for a photograph. They are all dressed in formal attire, with the men wearing grey suits and the women in purple dresses. The bride and groom are standing in the middle of the group, with the groom holding his bride's hand. They are all smiling and looking at the camera.

In the background, there is a row of trees and some bushes. The leaves on the trees are green, while the flowers on the bushes are pink and white. There is also a building in the background, but it is not clear what it is.

The lighting in the image is natural, with the sun shining down on the group from the left side. The shadows are long and deep, with the trees casting long shadows on the ground. The colors in the image are muted, with the purple and grey tones dominating.
