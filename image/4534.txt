This image shows a black mountain bike with yellow accents parked on a dirt road. It appears to be a full suspension mountain bike with large knobby tires and a dropper post. The carbon fiber frame is lightweight and strong. The dropper post enables the rider to adjust the saddle height for better control and comfort on steep descents.
