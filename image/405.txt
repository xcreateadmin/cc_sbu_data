The image depicts a white windmill with a red and white striped body on top of a hill overlooking the ocean. A small building with white walls and a red roof is in the foreground.

The windmill is an iconic symbol of Mykonos, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, and was used to grind wheat and other grains into flour. The small building in the foreground may be a taverna, a type of restaurant or cafe that serves traditional Greek food and drinks.
