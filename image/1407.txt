This is a black and white photograph of a man in a baseball uniform standing in front of a building with a sign that reads `dodgers house keep out'. The man is wearing a baseball cap, a jersey, and pants. He is holding a baseball glove in his left hand and his right hand is raised in the air, as if he is waving to someone. The building behind him has a brick facade, a small window on the left side, and a door on the right.
