The image shows a bride and groom standing in front of a large stained glass window with pink balloons floating above them. The bride is wearing a white wedding gown with a sweetheart neckline and the groom is wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black tie. They are both holding pink balloons and looking at each other with smiles on their faces. The background of the image is a large, empty church with pews and a high ceiling.
