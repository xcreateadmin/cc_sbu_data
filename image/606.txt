The image shows a large, dimly lit auditorium with rows of seats facing a stage. The stage is empty without actors or props. The auditorium has large windows that let in natural light and a high ceiling. The walls are white without decorations, and the floor is made of wooden planks without carpets or rugs. The atmosphere is empty and still.
