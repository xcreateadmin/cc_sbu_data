This image shows a living room with a wooden floor and a large window that lets in a lot of natural light. The walls are painted in a light blue color, and there are several shelves with books and other items on them. There is a large wooden table in the center of the room, with four chairs around it upholstered in a dark brown leather, and two lamps on the table. The room has a high ceiling with exposed wooden beams, and there is a chandelier hanging from the center. The overall style is modern and minimalist, with a focus on natural materials and neutral colors.
