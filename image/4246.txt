This is a black and white photograph of a woman in a white dress standing by a pool. The woman is wearing a long, flowing white dress with a high neckline and a slit up the side. The dress is billowing around her legs as she stands with her arms outstretched, looking off into the distance. There is a fountain in the background, with water spraying up into the air. The woman's hair is styled in loose, wavy curls, and she is wearing a pair of silver earrings and a bracelet on her left wrist.
