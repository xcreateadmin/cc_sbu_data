The image shows a necklace with a glass bottle filled with pink and white rocks. The bottle has a cork on top and is sitting on a piece of driftwood. The rocks inside the bottle appear to be smooth and polished. There is a chain attached to the top of the bottle, which is worn around the neck. The overall appearance of the necklace is rustic and natural, with a focus on the rocks inside the bottle.
