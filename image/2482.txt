This is an image of a man wearing protective gear, including a face mask and gloves, standing in front of a furnace. The furnace is made of metal and has a large opening at the top where molten metal is being poured into a mold. The metal is glowing orange. The room seems to be a factory or workshop, with pipes and other equipment visible in the background.
