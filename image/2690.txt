This is a photograph of a bride and her bridesmaids standing in a doorway. The bride is wearing a long, flowing dress in a light grey color, and her bridesmaids are wearing similar dresses in the same color. The bridesmaids have their arms around each other and are smiling at the camera. The walls of the room are painted white and there is a wooden floor. There are potted plants on either side of the doorway.
