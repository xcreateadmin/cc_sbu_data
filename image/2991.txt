The image shows a beautiful sunset over the ocean. The sky is a vibrant orange and pink, with the sun setting behind the horizon. The water is calm and reflects the colors of the sky. In the foreground, there are some rocks that jut out of the water. They are jagged and uneven, with some of them covered in seaweed. The colors of the rocks match the colors of the sky and water.
