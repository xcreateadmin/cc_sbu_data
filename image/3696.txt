This image shows a large tree stump that has been cut down. The stump is made up of several large pieces of wood that have been cut and stacked on top of each other. There is a small amount of dirt and debris on the ground around the stump. The tree appears to have been cut down with a chainsaw, as there are marks on the wood where the saw has been used. The stump is surrounded by grass and other vegetation, and there is a clear blue sky in the background.
