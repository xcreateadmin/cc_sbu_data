This is an image of the moon during a lunar eclipse. The moon appears red because it is being lit by the sun's light as it passes through the earth's atmosphere. The eclipse is caused by the moon passing between the earth and the sun, blocking the sun's light and casting a reddish glow on the moon's surface.
