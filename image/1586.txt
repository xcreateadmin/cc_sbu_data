This image shows a group of men in leather jackets gathered around a motorcycle parked outside a building. The motorcycle has a sidecar attached to it, and there are several other motorcycles parked nearby. The men are looking at something on the ground in front of the motorcycle, and one of them is holding a helmet in his hand. The building behind them appears to be made of brick and has a sign on the side that says "Harley Davidson."
