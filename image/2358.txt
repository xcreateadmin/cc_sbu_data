This is an image of a pirate ship made out of Lego bricks. The ship has a black hull with white sails and a red and white striped flag on the mast. It has two large cannons on the front and several smaller ones on the sides. Several pirate figures, including a captain with an eyepatch and a pirate with a parrot on his shoulder, are on the deck. The sails of the ship are billowing in the wind, suggesting that the ship is in motion.
