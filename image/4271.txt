The image shows a pair of women's leather sandals with an ankle strap. The sandals have a pointed toe and a high heel. The straps are made of a thin, adjustable material that wraps around the ankle and ties at the back. The sandals are made of a smooth, light brown leather with a matte finish. The heel is a medium height and is covered in the same leather as the rest of the sandal. The sole is flat and made of a light brown rubber.
