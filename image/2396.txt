This image is a line graph showing the percentage of poor below one half of the poverty line, 1990-2005. The graph indicates that the percentage of poor people below the poverty line has decreased from 20% in 1990 to 10% in 2005, depicting a considerable decrease in poverty over the last two decades. The trend of decreasing poverty has been relatively consistent over time, with minor fluctuations in the percentage of poor people. This suggests that efforts to reduce poverty have been successful and sustained over time.
