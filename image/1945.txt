This is a painting depicting a small village nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains. The village is made up of small, colorful houses with red roofs and white walls. In the foreground, there is a river running through the valley, with trees on either side. The mountains in the background are painted in various shades of blue, green, and purple. The sky is a vibrant orange and pink, with clouds floating in the distance, creating a peaceful and tranquil effect. There is a small, winding road in the foreground lined with trees and shrubs leading into the village. Some people are walking along the road. The houses have brightly painted doors and windows, and some have small gardens in front of them with flowers and shrubs.
