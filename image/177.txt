The image shows a group of men dressed in red and black uniforms, carrying rifles and marching down a street. They are part of a military parade or ceremony. The uniforms are similar to those worn by soldiers in the British army during the 19th century. The men are wearing red coats with black facings, black trousers, and black boots. They are also wearing black helmets with plumes on top. The rifles they are carrying are also black, with brass fittings and bayonets. The men are marching in formation, with one leading the way and the others following closely behind. The street is lined with people watching the parade, and there are buildings on either side. The image is in black and white, which gives it a historical feel.
