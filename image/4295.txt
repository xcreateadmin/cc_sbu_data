The painting depicts a snowy landscape with a farmhouse and a horse-drawn sleigh. The farmhouse has a red roof and white siding, and there is a barn in the background. The trees in the background are bare, but there is a small evergreen tree on the right side of the image. The sky is cloudy and overcast.
