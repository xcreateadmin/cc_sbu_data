The image shows two ears of corn on the cob. The corn is yellow and appears to be freshly harvested. There are several kernels visible on each ear, and the husks are still attached. The ears are lying on top of each other, with one ear slightly tilted to the side. The background is a blue sky with fluffy white clouds.
