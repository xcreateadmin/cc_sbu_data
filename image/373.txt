This is an image of a white swan swimming alone in a calm river. The swan's neck is stretched out and its beak is open as it swims towards the left side of the image. The water reflects the cloudy sky and some trees on the riverbank, as well as some buildings in the background. The swan's feathers look smooth and glossy in the water. It is a peaceful and serene image.
