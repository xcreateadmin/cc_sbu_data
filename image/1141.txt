The bike in the image is a road bike with a carbon fiber frame and disc brakes. It has a dropper post, allowing for a more aggressive riding position. The handlebars are also dropper and can be adjusted for a more upright riding position. The bike has a full carbon fiber fork and wheels, with deep section rims for improved aerodynamics and stiffness. The tires are tubeless, providing better grip and traction at lower pressures. The saddle is lightweight and ergonomic with a cutout to reduce pressure on the perineum.
