The woman is wearing a plaid shirt and a cowboy hat, and she is standing next to a white horse. The horse has a saddle on its back and a bridle in its mouth. The woman is holding the reins of the horse's bridle with one hand, and she is leaning down to pet the horse's neck with her other hand. There is a blue sky in the background, and some clouds can be seen in the distance.
