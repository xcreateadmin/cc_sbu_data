The painting depicts a group of Native American men on horseback chasing a herd of bison across a grassy plain. The men are dressed in traditional clothing, with feathers in their hair and bows and arrows in their hands. The bison are running in a panicked manner, with their heads down and tails up. In the background, there is a river with trees on the banks. The sky is a deep blue with a few fluffy clouds. The overall mood of the painting is one of action and movement.
