The image shows two men sitting on a red couch in a lobby or waiting area. One man is holding a tablet and the other is looking at it. They are both dressed in business attire, with the man on the left wearing a blue suit and the man on the right wearing a grey suit. There is a large window behind them with a view of a city skyline. The walls are painted a light grey and there are several plants in pots scattered around the room. The floor is made of wooden planks and there are two red chairs in front of the couch. The overall atmosphere of the image is professional and welcoming.
