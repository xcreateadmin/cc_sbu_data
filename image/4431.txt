The woman in the image is wearing a blue winter jacket with a fur collar and a red scarf around her neck. She is standing next to a suitcase with wheels, which appears to be empty. Behind her, there is a wall with graffiti on it, and in the background, there is a building with broken windows. The overall tone of the image is gritty and run down, with a sense of abandonment and decay.
