This is an image of an airplane flying in the sky at sunset. The plane is a large, commercial jet with a white body and red and blue stripes on the tail. It is flying low in the sky, with the sun setting behind it, casting a warm orange glow on the left side of the image and a blue glow on the right. The plane's engines are visible at the bottom of the image, with smoke coming from them. The sky is a deep blue, with clouds in the distance that are tinged with pink from the sunset.
