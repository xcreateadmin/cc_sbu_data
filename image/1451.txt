plates, which move and interact with each other, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges.

The image depicts the cross section of the Earth's crust and ocean floor. It consists of various layers such as the continental crust, oceanic crust, and mantle. The oceanic crust is denser and thicker as compared to the continental crust and composed of basaltic rock. The mantle is the thickest layer of the Earth's interior, made up of solid rock that flows slowly.

Furthermore, the image illustrates the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth's core. It protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation and charged particles from space.

The image also shows the lithosphere, the rigid outer layer of the Earth, consisting of the crust and uppermost part of the mantle. The lithosphere is divided into several large plates, which move and interact with each other, resulting in earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation
