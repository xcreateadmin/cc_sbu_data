This image depicts a group of people on a small wooden boat in the middle of a large body of water. The people on the boat are dressed in clothing from the 1800s, with men wearing top hats and women wearing long dresses. The sky is cloudy and there is a full moon in the background. The water is choppy and there are waves crashing against the boat, creating an adventurous and explorative mood.
