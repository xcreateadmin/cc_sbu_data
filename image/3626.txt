The image depicts an empty classroom with rows of wooden desks facing a green chalkboard. Each desk has a red chair on it. The chalkboard has some unclear writing on it, and the walls are painted white with no decorations or posters. The room is well-lit with fluorescent lights and windows on one wall. There are some plants in pots on the windowsill, and the floor is tiled.
