This is a diagram of the excretory system in the human body. The excretory system removes waste and excess fluids from the body, and includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood and produce urine. The ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until it is ready to be released, and the urethra carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The diagram illustrates the different parts of the excretory system and their functions.
