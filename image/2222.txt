This image is a psychedelic concert poster featuring a colorful, trippy design with a rainbow-colored background and two eyes peeking out from the top of the poster. The text on the poster reads, `'The Incredible String Band'Live at the Fillmore East.' The poster is designed to promote a concert by the Scottish folk rock band, The Incredible String Band, who performed at the Fillmore East in New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The poster is a classic example of the psychedelic art style that was popular in the 1960s and 1970s, with its bright colors, swirling patterns, and trippy imagery.
