The image shows a group of plants growing in a garden. The plants are tall and green, with long, thin leaves. They appear to be growing in a row, with some of them leaning over the edge of the garden bed. There is a wooden fence in the background, and some trees can be seen in the distance. The overall color scheme of the image is green, with some brown and gray tones in the sky and the fence.
