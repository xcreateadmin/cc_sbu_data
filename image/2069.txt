This image is a photograph of a person standing on a rocky beach with the ocean in the background. The person is standing with their back to the camera, looking out at the water. The waves are crashing against the shore and spraying water up into the air. In the foreground, there are some rocks and pebbles on the beach. The sky is a deep blue with some clouds visible in the distance. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene, with the person appearing to be lost in thought as they gaze out at the ocean.
