There are two plates on the table, one with an omelette and the other with a cup of coffee. A red and white checkered tablecloth covers the table, and a red and white striped napkin is on the plate with the omelette. Two forks, a knife, and a spoon are also on the table. A window with white curtains and a view of a garden can be seen in the background.
