This is an image of a planetary nebula. The nebula is a cloud of gas and dust that surrounds a star located at the center of the image. It is shown in shades of pink and purple, and is a result of the star's strong winds and radiation, which push the gas and dust away from the star. The resulting cloud forms the nebula, which is also known as a planetary nebula due to its resemblance to a planet when viewed through a telescope.
