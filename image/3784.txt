The image shows a lighthouse made of red brick with a white tower on top, situated on a grassy hill overlooking the ocean. Several trees surround the lighthouse. A concrete path leads up to the lighthouse, which has no people nearby. The ocean in the background is a deep blue with some whitecaps on the surface, stretching out to the horizon. The image is peaceful and serene, with the lighthouse standing tall against the clear blue sky.
