The man in the image is wearing a red coat, black pants, and a black hat with a feather. He is holding a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. He is standing on a rock in the middle of a body of water. The sky is dark and stormy, with lightning flashing in the distance. The man appears to be a pirate, with a long beard and a scruffy appearance.
