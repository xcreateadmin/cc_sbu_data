This is a black and white photograph of two women sitting on a bench by the ocean, with rocks and seaweed in the foreground and the ocean visible in the background. The women have their arms around each other and are both smiling. They are sitting on a wooden bench attached to a pier or jetty that extends into the water. The bench is old and weathered, with cracks and splinters visible in the wood. The women are both wearing vintage dresses and hats.
